Technologies

- [How to use create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [**Use typescript with React**](https://alligator.io/react/typescript-with-react/#create-react-app-and-typescript) while using `create-react-app` to scaffold the project.
- [Deploy repo to github as a live website using gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)
    - If you got a 404 page, and you made sure your homepage url is correct in `package.json`, chances are the page is updating so may need some time reflecting the new deployment. In short: be faithful & patient!
